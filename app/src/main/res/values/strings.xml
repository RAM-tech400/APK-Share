    <string name="about_text">"    Sharing the installation file of applications is always a big problem on android devices. Of course, some smartphone maker companies add a feature to self android shell for making this work easier like as MIUI from Xiaomi. But in most android devices like Samsung devices, Google pixels, etc, this feature does not exist. So you should use it from third-party apps. Now the problem is here that there is not almost any good application for this work.\n    I am happy to say I understand this problem, and to solve it, I made this application and am developing it. You can share 5 apk files together in one moment with this app. This app supports two languages, and you can customize the most of its parts for your. Anyway, it is not great and has many problems, sure.\n    I'll be glad to hear your opinions and feedback about it because this work helps me make this application better than the past, so please report any problems if you find them from the help and feedback section. Also, you can help me by developing this app with me from its repository on my github. and for the end, I should say I always try to find our problems and solve those by my skills.\n    Don't forget to be happy:-)"</string>
